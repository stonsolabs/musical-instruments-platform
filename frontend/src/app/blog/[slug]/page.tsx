        <p>Buying your first guitar is an exciting milestone, but it can also be overwhelming with so many options available. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the process and find the perfect instrument for your needs.</p>
        
        <h2 id="acoustic-vs-electric">Acoustic vs Electric: Which Should You Choose?</h2>
        <p>The first decision you'll need to make is whether to go with an acoustic or electric guitar. Each has its advantages:</p>
        
        <h3>Acoustic Guitars</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No amplifier needed - you can play anywhere</li>
          <li>Great for learning fingerpicking and strumming</li>
          <li>Perfect for folk, country, and singer-songwriter styles</li>
          <li>Generally more affordable to get started</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Electric Guitars</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>More versatile for different genres</li>
          <li>Easier on the fingers for beginners</li>
          <li>Great for rock, blues, jazz, and metal</li>
          <li>Requires an amplifier (additional cost)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="budget-considerations">Budget Considerations</h2>
        <p>Your budget will significantly influence your choice. Here's what to expect at different price points:</p>
        
        <h3>€100-300: Beginner Level</h3>
        <p>These guitars are perfect for absolute beginners. They may not have the best sound quality, but they're playable and will help you learn the basics.</p>
        
        <h3>€300-700: Intermediate Level</h3>
        <p>This is the sweet spot for most beginners. You'll get much better quality and sound, and these guitars will last you for years.</p>
        
        <h3>€700+: Advanced Level</h3>
        <p>These are professional-quality instruments with excellent craftsmanship and sound quality.</p>
        
        <h2 id="essential-features">Essential Features to Look For</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Action:</strong> The distance between strings and fretboard should be comfortable</li>
          <li><strong>Intonation:</strong> The guitar should stay in tune up and down the neck</li>
          <li><strong>Build Quality:</strong> Look for solid construction and good materials</li>
          <li><strong>Playability:</strong> The neck should feel comfortable in your hands</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="accessories">Essential Accessories</h2>
        <p>Don't forget these important accessories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Guitar Case:</strong> Protect your investment</li>
          <li><strong>Guitar Stand:</strong> Keep your guitar safe and accessible</li>
          <li><strong>Extra Strings:</strong> Strings break and wear out</li>
          <li><strong>Tuner:</strong> Essential for keeping your guitar in tune</li>
          <li><strong>Picks:</strong> Try different thicknesses to find what you prefer</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
