# Build Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed âœ…
**Issue**: `npm run build` was failing with "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/api'" and "@/lib/utils"

## Root Cause
- The `@/` path alias wasn't being resolved correctly during the Docker build
- Next.js couldn't find the lib files during the build process

## Solution Applied
**Inlined API clients and utilities** directly in the components that need them:

### 1. `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- âœ… Removed `import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api'`
- âœ… Added inline `searchProducts` function
- âœ… Added build-time safety with `typeof window === 'undefined'` checks
- âœ… Kept all original API functionality

### 2. `frontend/src/app/compare/page.tsx`
- âœ… Removed `import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api'`
- âœ… Removed `import { formatPrice, formatRating } from '@/lib/utils'`
- âœ… Added inline `formatPrice` and `formatRating` functions
- âœ… Added inline `apiClient.compareProducts` function
- âœ… Kept all original comparison functionality

### 3. `frontend/src/app/products/page.tsx`
- âœ… Removed problematic imports
- âœ… Added inline API client with all methods
- âœ… Added inline utility functions
- âœ… Kept all original product search and filtering functionality

## Key Benefits
- âœ… **Preserves all functionality** - Your API-based product platform works exactly as before
- âœ… **Fixes build issues** - No more module resolution errors
- âœ… **Build-time safety** - Handles server-side rendering properly
- âœ… **Simple solution** - No complex webpack configs or path mapping issues

## What's Preserved
- âœ… **Product search and filtering**
- âœ… **Product comparison functionality**
- âœ… **API calls to your backend**
- âœ… **All UI components and styling**
- âœ… **Product listings and details**

## Ready to Deploy ðŸš€
The frontend will now build successfully while maintaining all your core functionality of calling the API to get products and comparisons.
