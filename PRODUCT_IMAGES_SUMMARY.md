## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Current Setup
```bash
# Check your current database connection
python test-api-connection.js
```

```bash
# Run the product update script
python run_image_update.py
```

### Step 3: Verify Results

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- **Brands**: Added 7 new brands (Roland, Pearl, Boss, Electro-Harmonix, Pioneer, Numark, Focusrite, Shure)
- **Categories**: Created 7 new categories to match navigation
- **Products**: Expanded from 6 to 18 products total
- **Images**: Each product now has 4 high-quality image URLs

### Frontend Integration
The images will automatically display in:
- ✅ Product listing pages (`/products`)
- ✅ Category pages (`/products?category=...`)
- ✅ Product comparison pages (`/compare`)
- ✅ Individual product detail pages

### Image Display Logic
```typescript
// Products now display images using:
{product.images && product.images.length > 0 ? (
  <img src={product.images[0]} alt={product.name} />
) : (
  <span className="text-gray-400 text-5xl">🎸</span>
)}
```
