**IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT:**

I need you to help me implement a European Musical Instruments comparison platform using the complete technical specifications I have. This is a production-ready affiliate marketing platform with AI-powered content generation.

**TECH STACK:**
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) + PostgreSQL + Redis + OpenAI API
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) + Railway/Render (Backend)

**KEY FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:**
1. Product comparison engine (2-10 products side-by-side)
2. Multi-store price tracking (Amazon, Thomann, Gear4Music, Kytary)
3. AI content generation (descriptions, pros/cons, recommendations)
4. Advanced search and filtering system
5. SEO-optimized pages for European markets
6. Affiliate link tracking and analytics
7. Mobile-responsive design

**PROJECT STRUCTURE:**
```

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/                   # Next.js Frontend
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/               # App Router pages
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # React components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/              # API client, utilities
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/            # TypeScript definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ next.config.js
â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml         # Development environment
```

**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:**
1. Start with the complete file structure and core FastAPI backend
2. Implement database models and API endpoints
3. Create React components and Next.js pages
4. Add AI content generation and affiliate integration
5. Setup development environment with Docker
6. Create deployment scripts for production

**REVENUE MODEL:**
- Affiliate commissions (3-7% from major music stores)
- Target: â‚¬25K-â‚¬75K monthly revenue within 12 months
- 100K+ monthly visitors goal

Please start by creating the complete project structure and implementing the core FastAPI backend with all models, schemas, and main API endpoints. Then we'll move to the frontend implementation.

**IMPORTANT:** I have detailed specifications for each component including:
- Complete database schema with sample data
- All API endpoints with full implementation
- React components with TypeScript
- AI content generation prompts
- Affiliate integration logic
- Deployment configurations

Are you ready to start implementing this platform step by step?
